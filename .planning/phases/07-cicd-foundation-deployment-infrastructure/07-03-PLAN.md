<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Update README with CI status badges</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
    Update README.md to add status badges immediately below the title.

    Replace the current header section with:

    ```markdown
    # @decentralized-games/card-components

    [![CI/CD Pipeline](https://github.com/o2alexanderfedin/decentralized-card-games/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/o2alexanderfedin/decentralized-card-games/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
    [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@decentralized-games/card-components)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@decentralized-games/card-components)
    [![bundle size](https://img.shields.io/bundlephobia/minzip/@decentralized-games/card-components)](https://bundlephobia.com/package/@decentralized-games/card-components)

    React component library for visualizing and interacting with playing cards.
    ```

    Per CONTEXT.md decision: "Badges: Build status, test coverage, bundle size, npm version (all four)"
    Note: Coverage badge deferred until coverage reporting is added to CI.

    Keep the existing git-flow documentation sections as they provide valuable onboarding info.

    Update the description to match the package.json description and actual library functionality:
    - Replace blockchain-focused description with component library description
    - The library is about card visualization, not blockchain

  <what-built>
    CI and deployment workflows created in .github/workflows/
    README updated with status badges
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. **Review workflows:** Check that `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` exist
    2. **Review README badges:** Verify badge URLs point to correct repository
    3. **Make repository public (REPO-01):**
       - Go to https://github.com/o2alexanderfedin/decentralized-card-games/settings
       - Scroll to "Danger Zone" section
       - Click "Change repository visibility"
       - Select "Make public"
       - Confirm the action
    4. **Configure GitHub Pages source (required for deploy workflow):**
       - Go to Settings > Pages
       - Under "Build and deployment", change Source to "GitHub Actions"
       - This enables the deploy workflow to push to GitHub Pages
    5. **Push changes to trigger CI:**
       - After making repo public, push the new workflows to see them run
       - Verify CI jobs appear in the Actions tab
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "verified" after completing repository settings and confirming CI runs, or describe any issues</resume-signal>
