### Performance

- **PERF-01**: Virtualization for rendering 100+ cards
- **PERF-02**: Server-Side Rendering (SSR) support
- **PERF-03**: React Server Components compatibility

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Game logic (Poker, Durak rules) | Library focuses on UI only; game rules couple to specific games and limit reusability |
| Multiplayer/networking | Server communication is application concern, not component library |
| Player management | User/session management belongs in consuming application |
| Scoring systems | Game-specific logic, not UI library responsibility |
| AI opponents | Complex game logic, out of scope for component library |
| Blockchain/decentralization | Deferred to future platform work, not part of base library |
| Card builder UI | Data model supports it, but builder interface deferred to v2 |
| Image assets for cards | Using emoji/CSS only to keep library lightweight |

## Milestone Summary

**Shipped:** 48 of 48 v1 requirements (100%)
**Adjusted:** None — all requirements shipped as originally defined
**Dropped:** None — full requirement coverage achieved

### Notable Implementation Details

- **FNDN-03 (Card flip):** Implemented with Motion library useSpring instead of manual CSS animations for smoother physics
- **DND-05 (Touch support):** Required separate TouchSensor + MouseSensor (not PointerSensor) for iOS Safari scroll prevention
- **STATE-01 (Redux optional):** Implemented dual-mode architecture with StateBackend interface for seamless Context/Redux switching
- **A11Y-06 (Reduced motion):** Crossfade animation (250ms opacity transition) used instead of 3D flip when prefers-reduced-motion enabled
- **BUILD-02 (Dual output):** Two-pass Vite build required (ESM multi-entry + UMD single-entry) due to format incompatibility
